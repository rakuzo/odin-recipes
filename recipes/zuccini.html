    <h2>Eggplant Zucchini Pasta Bake with Mushrooms</h2>
    <p>This zucchini, eggplant, and mushroom pasta is a wonderful tribute to Italian cuisine.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients to make Zuccini</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 eggplant, diced into 1/2-inch squares</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>4 mushrooms, chopped</li>
        <li>1 (26 ounce) jar plain tomato sauce</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried marjoram, or to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups farfalle (bow tie) pasta</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 (7 ounce) package mozzarella cheese, cut into strips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps to make Zuccini</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Cook eggplant in the boiling water until mostly tender, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute zucchini and garlic until zucchini starts to soften, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining olive oil in another saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute onion until golden, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour wine into the zucchini mixture; reduce heat and simmer until liquid is nearly gone, about 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook farfalle pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour a thin layer of sauce into the bottom of a lasagna dish. Add a portion of the 1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese and mozzarella strips.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is well melted, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
