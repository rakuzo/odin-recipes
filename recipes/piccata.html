        <h2>Steps to make Zuccini</h2>
        <div class="blue-box">
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a saucepan of water to a boil. Cook eggplant in the boiling water until mostly tender, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Saute zucchini and garlic until zucchini starts to soften, about 5 minutes. Add mushrooms; cook until beginning to brown, about 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Heat remaining olive oil in another saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute onion until golden, about 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour wine into the zucchini mixture; reduce heat and simmer until liquid is nearly gone, about 6 minutes.</li>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook farfalle pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
                <li>Pour a thin layer of sauce into the bottom of a lasagna dish. Add a portion of the 1 3/4 cups plus 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese and mozzarella strips.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is well melted, about 20 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
